Foreign Domain Routing
===========

Foreign Domain Routing provides simple handling of foreign domains in Rails.
It borrows largely from SubdomainFu and some other snippets found around the web.

Installation
============

Foreign Domain Routing is available as a plugin. To install it with Rails 2.1 
or later):

script/plugin install git://github.com/brianmulloy/foreign_domain_routing.git

Examples
========

Foreign Domain Routing extends Rails's routing mechanisms to provide a way to 
redirect non-native domains. 

Let's say my rails app domain is 'mydomain.com' and I am creating an app that
allows users to add a CNAME record to map their subdomain so that 
'foo.usersdomain.com' would actually point to 'mydomain.com/users/1234'.

The route at the top of config/routes.rb would look like:

map.connect '*path', :controller => 'users',
:action => 'index', :conditions => { :foreign_domain => true }

And in the users controller:

@user = User.find_by_foreign_domain(request.host.downcase) 
# this example would require a database field called foreign_domain

Configuration
=============

You will need to configure Foreign Domain Routing based on your native hostnames. 

native_domains
--------

A hash of arrays for the native domain names for each relevant environment.

Create the file config/initializers/native_domains.rb and put something like:

ForeignDomainRouting.init_native_domains = {
  :development => ['localhost'], 
  :staging => ['staging.example.com'],
  :production => ['example.com', 'example.org', 'example.net']
} # set all at once (also the defaults)


Or set the native domains on the fly with:

ForeignDomainRouting.native_domains = 
  ['example.com', 'example.org', 'example.net'] # sets for current environment
